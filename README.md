# Bytestorm

![temp logo](assets/bytestorm_temp.png)

Bytestorm is a playground sandbox for the computer. You are supposed to do random stuff and build random things and have fun.

The Bytestorm environment is meant to be constrained to the following tasks, languages, filetypes, and filekinds (categories of intended use):

## Tasks

### 1. **Ideation** 
Brainstorming, concept formation, learning
### 2. **Data Analysis**
Statistics, charts, models of data
### 3. **Static Web Development**
Websites, frontend, prototyping
### 4. **Process Automation**
Scripts, pipelines, recurring jobs
### 5. **APIs and Services**
Interfaces, contracts, servers
### 6. **Full Stack Web Development**
Deployment, payment, monitoring

## Languages

### 1. **Bash**
language for terminals, scripts, communicating with remote machines
### 2. **Python**
basic language for apps and data analysis with a broad library ecosystem
### 3. **JavaScript/TypeScript + HTML + CSS**
basic bundle of languages for web development
### 4. **SQL**
classic language for data storage, schemas, querying, metrics, logging
### 5. **Go**
modern language for concurrency, system tools, microservices
### 6. **Ruby on Rails**
full-stack web development framework with business features

## Filekinds

### 1. Unstructured Text
`.txt`, `.md`

### 2. Image
`.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`

### 3. Audio
`.mp3`

### 4. Video
`.mp4`, `.mov`

### 5. Presentation
`.pdf`, `.ppt`, `.pptx`, `.key`, `.ipynb`

### 6. Schematic Data
`.json` (data), `.csv`, `.db`, `.sqlite`

### 7. Code
- **Shell**: `.sh`
- **Python**: `.py`, `.ipynb`
- **Web 1: JS+HTML+CSS**: `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.html`, `.css`
- **SQL**: `.sql`
- **Go**: `.go`, `.mod`
- **Web 2: Rub on Rails**: `.rb`, `.erb`

### 8. Config
`.env`, `.yaml`, `.json` (config), `.lock`, `.toml`, `.xml`, `.gitignore`, `Dockerfile`

### Filetypes

```
.css, .csv, .db, Dockerfile, .env, .erb, .gitignore, .go, .html, .ipynb, .jpg, .js, .json, .jsx, .key, .lock, .md, .mod, .mov, .mp3, .mp4, .pdf, .png, .ppt, .pptx, .py, .rb, .sh, .sql, .sqlite, .svg, .toml, .ts, .tsx, .txt, .xml, .yaml
```

## Bytestorm Project Vision

This is an early project that is not clearly defined, but my hope is to explore and narrow in on the right design choices.

Eventually, Bytestorm will be technology that comes pre-packaged with the ability to do ANYTHING within a pre-specified set of CONSTRAINTS. 

Note that this is different from 2025-era LLMs and agents, which promise to have all the skills on the internet at a superhuman level. Those are not well-formalized constraints, and this lack of formalization makes the benefit of LLMs and agents fuzzy and questionable. In contrast, Bytestorm promises to do a much narrow range of things, but promises to be really excellent at them.
